<h2><a name="CHAPTER_I" id="CHAPTER_I">CHAPTER I</a></h2>

<div class='chaptertitle'>ONCE WHEN BOBBY WASN'T
LEFT BEHIND</div>


<p>Bobby North went out into the front yard
by the iron gate between the two tall stone
columns to watch the horses and wagons and
'mobiles traveling up and down that invitingly
dusty and mysterious road that he was
forbidden ever to set foot upon.</p>

<p>He knew he could crawl under the gate,
he was so little, and raise clouds of dust by
dragging his feet in the road as two small
boys did who passed by and stopped to gaze
in wonder at Bobby and at the big brick
house set back in the yard among some trees.
He wondered if the Supe'tendent would <em>really</em>
send him to bed without anything to eat if
he disobeyed her just this once and slipped
under the gate, out into the road for as many
as forty or a dozen minutes.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[8]</a></span></p>

<p>He was afraid she <em>really</em> might, and was
standing with face pressed against the iron
bars of the gate when a man drove up back
of him with a buggy jammed as full as it
would hold of boys and girls from the Home.</p>

<p>"Bobby North!" cried the sharp, irritated
voice of the Supe'tendent. "How many times
must I tell you to keep away from that gate!"</p>

<p>He turned clear around and saw on the
porch the tall, thin figure of the Supe'tendent.
The man in the buggy jumped out to open
the gate. Bobby stepped back from the
graveled road, for he knew by experience
that it is always safer, if you are a small boy,
to keep out of the way of grown-up folks&mdash;<em>then</em>
they can't scold you for doing something
you mustn't, or not doing something you
should, even when you had never <em>thought</em> of
doing either one.</p>

<p>He looked up longingly at the buggy load of
boys and girls who were going to explore the
mysteries of that delightfully dusty road and
not coming back for maybe forty or a dozen
days. Bobby was used to being left behind and
stepped further away, but without taking his
lonely eyes off those more fortunate children.</p>

<p>When the man had opened the gate, he
stopped and looked at Bobby and then at
the Supe'tendent on the porch. He came<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[9]</a></span>
directly towards Bobby as he kept backing
away, caught him up in his arms and tossed
him into the lap of the lady who sat on the
front seat!</p>

<p>"You'd like a whole week in the country,
too, wouldn't you?" said the man.</p>

<p>"Yes'm."</p>

<p>Bobby was so surprised that that was all
he could think of to say.</p>

<p>"I'm afraid he will be too much trouble for
you," called the Supe'tendent. "He's so
young."</p>

<p>Bobby steeled his heart and started to
climb down from the lady's lap, but his lower
lip twitched in spite of his effort to keep it
steady.</p>

<p>"Nonsense!" exclaimed the man, as he led
the horses out into the road, shut the gate,
jumped into the seat by the woman and
drove off in a cloud of dust. He didn't seem
to be at all afraid of the much-to-be-feared
Supe'tendent!</p>

<p>Bobby was so glad to be riding away from
the Home that he thought he almost <em>liked</em>
the Supe'tendent this once, and looked back
and waved good-bye to her. She stood
there stiff and angry and did not reply.</p>

<p>Thus it came about that Bobby North had
his first trip away from the Home that he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[10]</a></span>
could remember. The week at Mr. and
Mrs. Robert Eller's in the country was a
glorious time&mdash;days to be remembered by all
the red letters on the playing blocks that
were sometimes given him on a Sunday to
keep him quiet.</p>

<p>Besides the calves and little pigs, the
clover field and the daisies in the yard, there
was the two-months' old puppy that Mr.
Eller's little boy told him was a St. Bernard.
It soon became the chief delight of this
puppy to chase Bobby about the yard and
trip him and then, when he fell headlong, to
lick his hands and face affectionately with a
moist, red tongue. The man never once
objected to his playing with the awkward
and much-to-be-desired puppy all day long.</p>

<p>He was an answer to ardent and secret
prayer, this Man Who Lets You Play with
the Puppy, and Bobby looked up to him with
a great deal of awe; his words carried the
weight of authority. He seemed to understand
what small boys want, to know that
the greatest of all treasures, a real live puppy,
is good for them.</p>

<p>Thus the happy days in the country passed
like magic.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_II" id="CHAPTER_II">CHAPTER II</a></h2>

<div class='chaptertitle'>THE BOY WITH EIGHT BIRTHDAYS</div>


<p>One afternoon the puppy was not to be
found anywhere. Bobby returned to the
front yard at Mr. Eller's, after a vain search
for his playmate, and found that <em>that</em> day
was a very special occasion.</p>

<p>The grown-ups, and the children, too, were
celebrating something which seemed to be
called a "birthdays." It belonged to Richard,
the small son of the Man Who Lets You
Play with the Puppy. It was the boy's
eighth birthdays, and he was very proud of
that fact.</p>

<p>There was ice-cream&mdash;enough so that
Bobby's dish was heaped full a second time<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[12]</a></span>
without asking and before he had quite
finished the first helping&mdash;and cake and two
big red and white apples for each child.
Bobby was still munching contentedly away
at his first apple, the other clutched tightly
in his left hand, when Richard's mothers led
the children into the house to see the
"presents."</p>

<p>There was quite an array of them&mdash;enough
Bobby decided for all eight birthdays and he
vaguely wondered if all eight of them had
come on that one day. There was a baseball,
and a bat, a dozen marbles&mdash;"glassies"
Richard called them, presents it seemed from
his fathers; a nice, new, starchy white blouse
with blue trousers, a gift from his mothers.
Then there was a pair of high boots with a
copper plate on the point of each toe, sent
him by his Uncle John in the city.</p>

<p>Last of all there was something out at the
barn which was to be sold when "they" grew
up and help to buy something for Richard
some day which his fathers never had&mdash;"an
edge-cation."</p>

<p>"They" proved to be six little pigs with
curly tails and squealy voices. Bobby wondered
if Richard wouldn't grow up before
they did, he was so much bigger, and then
what would become of his edge-cation?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[13]</a></span></p>

<p>He fell to wondering about this thing
called a birthdays. As near as he could
make out, it was a very special day on which
everybody&mdash;at least your fathers and
mothers, if you had such possessions&mdash;unaccountably
gave you playthings that you had
always wanted, such as "glassies" and baseballs
and, yes, little curly-tailed pigs that
were to help buy you an edge-cation.</p>

<p>He decided he wanted a birthdays, but
didn't know the least thing about how to go
about it to get one. He determined to ask
and went immediately to Richard who,
having eight birthdays of his own, must be
an authority on the matter.</p>

<p>"Where did you get your birthdays?"
he asked in what he thought was a very loud
voice, but apparently it wasn't for Richard
said "Huh?" and for a moment stopped trying
to straighten the curls out of the tails of
the little pigs. Bobby repeated his question
and added wistfully:</p>

<p>"Never had none."</p>

<p>"You have, too," said Richard.</p>

<p>"Ain't not," said Bobby resolutely.</p>

<p>"You have, too," repeated Richard.</p>

<p>Bobby fell silent under that assertion and
tried to remember when anybody had ever
given him presents. He could recall no<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[14]</a></span>
such occasion. Then an explanation came
to him.</p>

<p>"P'raps," he suggested timidly, "you only
have birthdays when you have fathers and
mothers and things like that."</p>

<p>"Everybody has birthdays," said Richard
from the lofty peak of his superior years.</p>

<p>Bobby again remained silent and Richard,
to add the final, crushing blow, gave further
information.</p>

<p>"Everybody has fathers and mothers,
<em>some</em> time."</p>

<p>"P'raps I'm not big enough yet to have
fathers and mothers and birthdays. How
big will I have to be?"</p>

<p>Richard snorted in derision.</p>

<p>"<em>They</em> have <em>you</em>," he said and turned his
attention to straightening out the curls from
his pigs' tails.</p>

<p>Bobby did not understand, but felt that
somehow he was in the wrong, and he went
off a ways by himself and took the first
comforting bite out of his other apple, carefully
choosing the side with the most red
on it.</p>

<p>After a time Richard convinced himself
that the kink was a part of the pig's tail and
stopped trying to uncurl it. Then his eye
fell on Bobby and he scowled fiercely.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[15]</a></span></p>

<p>"Everybody has birthdays," he said.
"What you done with yours?"</p>

<p>"Not done nothing with it," replied Bobby.
Then, after a time, "Never had none."</p>

<p>"Papa," called Richard to the Man Who
Lets You Play with the Puppy, "Bobby says
he hasn't got a birthday. Everybody has
birthdays, haven't they, papa?"</p>

<p>Mr. Eller was talking with his wife and
paid no attention.</p>

<p>"Everybody has birthdays, haven't they,
papa?" This time Richard yelled so loud
his father couldn't help hearing.</p>

<p>"Yes, of course," he replied carelessly.</p>

<p>"There, I told you so!" said Richard.</p>

<p>"Ain't not," insisted Bobby stubbornly,
and hunted out another red spot on his apple.</p>

<p>Richard seemed to take Bobby's words as
a personal affront.</p>

<p>"Papa, he has too, hasn't he, papa?"</p>

<p>"Has what?" asked Mr. Eller impatiently.</p>

<p>"Bobby has too a birthday, hasn't he?"</p>

<p>"Everybody has a birthday," replied his
father.</p>

<p>"I told you so! I told you so!" chanted
Richard, skipping about. "Bobby North
has lost his birthday! Bobby North has
lost his birthday and don't know where to
find it!"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[16]</a></span></p>

<p>"Ain't not," repeated Bobby and his lower
lip began to twist up. "Wouldn't lose a
'portant thing like a birthdays."</p>

<p>Mr. Eller and his wife approached the
children. That capable woman put her hand
on Bobby's head.</p>

<p>"Haven't they ever celebrated your birthday
at the Home?" she asked.</p>

<p>"Perhaps they don't know when it is,"
Mr. Eller suggested in a low voice to his
wife.</p>

<p>"Couldn't lose it, could I?" appealed
Bobby to the Man Who Lets You Play with
the Puppy.</p>

<p>"Some children lose their birthday before
they are big enough to know what it is," comforted
Mr. Eller.</p>

<p>"Bobby North has lost his birthday and
don't know where to find it!" chanted
Richard in derision.</p>

<p>"Ain't not," repeated Bobby dismally.</p>

<p>"That will do, Richard," said Mr. Eller
severely. "Go and play pump-pump-pull-away
with the other children."</p>

<p>"Yes, sir," said Richard and went obediently
off, turning back only once to make
a face at the boy who had lost his birthday.</p>

<p>"Never mind, Bobby," said Mr. Eller.
"You'll find it some day."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[17]</a></span></p>

<p>"When I get growed up?"</p>

<p>"Perhaps sooner. I'll see the Superintendent.
We may be able to find it for you."</p>

<p>"Could <em>I</em> find it if I hunted and hunted all
day long, like the spoon?" queried Bobby
eagerly.</p>

<p>The Man Who Lets You Play with the
Puppy laughed.</p>

<p>"Don't worry about your birthday, Bobby.
You'll stumble across it some day when you
are walking along and not thinking about it."</p>

<p>"It won't matter if you don't, dear," said
Mrs. Eller. "Folks will love you just the
same."</p>

<p>"No'm," said Bobby skeptically, replying
to her first statement, and retiring under a
tree to puzzle over the matter and consume
the rest of the apple. The other children
were playing their games and Mr. and Mrs.
Eller soon went into the house.</p>

<p>Bobby decided that the lady, Richard's
mothers, didn't know the importance of a
birthdays, whereas <em>nothing</em> could be more important.
Birthdays brought little boys all
the things they had always wanted, like
"glassies" and baseball bats and little pigs.
He knew he wanted the "glassies" and the
bat and wasn't quite sure but that he might
want the pigs to help buy an edge-cation<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[18]</a></span>
when he grew to be as big as Richard's
fathers who said he wished that he had one.</p>

<p>If he had really lost his birthdays <em>himself</em>,
he might find it as he did the spoon which he
lost in the yard one day. The Supe'tendent
made him hunt and hunt for it till
he couldn't see for the water in his eyes.
And then, suddenly, he stepped on it when
he wasn't thinking about it and bent it all
twisty-like. What if he should step on his
birthdays and bend it just as he had the
spoon? He must be very careful where he
stepped. Didn't the Man Who Lets You
Play with the Puppy say he would find his
birthdays some time when he was walking
along and not thinking about it?</p>

<p>He wanted very much to find his birthdays;
so he must be up and about it. He
would start at once; he might find it before
night and would show that Richard
that he <em>did</em> know where to find his birthdays.
He knew that he could walk ever so far, but
was not so sure that he could keep from
thinking about what he was looking for. It
was worth trying anyway. If only he might
step on his birthdays! He must be careful
though not to step on it with all his weight
and bend it as he did the spoon&mdash;it might be
harder to straighten it out.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[19]</a></span></p>

<p>He rose and started for the road. The
other children were too busy with their
playing to notice him. Stepping lightly,
with eyes fixed on the ground, Bobby trudged
out through the yard into the road.</p>

<p>So he started out on his strange quest.</p>

<div class='chaptertitle'>HUNTING FOR THE THING YOU
MUSN'T THINK ABOUT</div>


<p>When he had gone a long way, Bobby
crossed the road and crawled under the fence
into the field beyond. He tried so hard not
to think about the thing he was searching
for that he forgot all about the fact that it
had been hours since dinner and that the
sun's bedtime could not be so very far off.
One can't remember <em>everything</em> when trying
so hard not to think of <em>one</em> thing. He <em>wasn't</em>
thinking of that&mdash;only of the presents Richard
had received, and <em>that</em> wasn't the same!</p>

<p>He trudged on till his short legs grew
weary, always looking down at the ground<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[21]</a></span>
and stepping, oh, so lightly! He was startled
when a big gruff voice suddenly boomed out
right in front of him:</p>

<p>"Hullo, Bub! What're you doin' out
here?"</p>

<p>Bobby was so astounded that he blurted
out the truth without thinking.</p>

<p>"Hunting for my birthdays."</p>

<p>"Huntin' for your birthday, huh? Well,
now, what do you think of that, Steve?"
And the rough, bearded man who had spoken
to him, winked prodigiously at the youth
who was helping him mend a broken place in
the fence.</p>

<p>"Where'd-ja lose it?" asked the youth.</p>

<p>"Don't know," confessed Bobby.</p>

<p>"That's a funny thing to lose," said the
rough, bearded man. "Sure you had one?"</p>

<p>"Don't perzactly 'member," replied Bobby.
Then a dreadful thought came to him:
he was <em>thinking</em> about his birthdays! "Please,
I musn't not think about it."</p>

<p>The bearded man burst out laughing.</p>

<p>"You're a funny codger! Huntin' for
something you mustn't think about! What
do you think of that, Steve?"</p>

<p>Steve didn't think very highly of the
matter, Bobby was sure from the way he
laughed.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[22]</a></span></p>

<p>"Does your mother know you're out?"
asked Steve, and in turn exchanged another
prodigious wink with the man with whiskers.</p>

<p>"Ain't not got any mothers," said Bobby.</p>

<p>"Oh," said the bearded man in a different
voice, "you're one of the kids old man Eller
has out to his place."</p>

<p>"Yes'm," Bobby admitted and began to
back away. These men were making fun of
him and he felt uncomfortable, and they had
made him <em>think</em> of his birthdays! He had
taken only a few backward steps when a
big pleasant voice behind him made him
jump.</p>

<p>"Quite a ways from home, aren't you, son?"</p>

<p>"I'm hunting my&mdash;&mdash;," but Bobby remembered
just in time and stopped.
"Yes'm," he added and turned to look up
into a pair of friendly blue eyes and at lips
that smiled under a blond mustache that
curled up at the ends. The man put a hand
on Bobby's shoulder and drew him closer.</p>

<p>"Lost, are you? Well, we'll soon fix that.
What is your name?"</p>

<p>"No'm," said Bobby, trying to answer the
man's questions in order.</p>

<p>"No'm! That's a funny name!" exclaimed
the man and laughed till his eyes all crinkled
up.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[23]</a></span></p>

<p>"No'm's not my name!" laughed Bobby.
"No'm, I'm not lost, I'm hunting&mdash;&mdash;"
Again he remembered just in time and
stopped.</p>

<p>"That's a secret, is it? Is your name,
too?"</p>

<p>"Bobby North," he replied and smiled up
at this man who laughed at him without
making fun of him.</p>

<p>"Where do you live?"</p>

<p>"Way off&mdash;<em>there</em>," replied Bobby, pointing
over the tops of the trees.</p>

<p>"Oh, up there! You've chosen a fine
home&mdash;"</p>

<p>"He's one of the kids at Eller's place,
Mr. Anning," interrupted the man with the
whiskers.</p>

<p>"He's huntin' for his birthday which he
was careless enough to lose," added Steve.</p>

<p>"Was not care-<em>less!</em>" Denied Bobby and
that unsteady lower lip began to tremble.</p>

<p>"Of course you were not careless," said
the man with the mustache. "Somebody
just forgot to tell you. Here, take this."</p>

<p>He put his hand in his pocket and drew it
out full of money. He selected a large shining
white piece and put it in Bobby's hand.</p>

<p>"Here's a quarter for you. Now it will
soon be sundown and you'd better make<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[24]</a></span>
tracks for Mr. Eller's. Know how to find
it?"</p>

<p>"Thank you," said Bobby, clutching the
quarter and not forgetting what the
Supe'tendent told him to say whenever anybody
gave him anything. Then, after a
time, he remembered the man's question and
he replied to it. "Yes'm."</p>

<p>"That's it&mdash;that house way over there on
the other side of the road," said the man.
"Keep your eyes on the house and you can't
miss it."</p>

<p>"Yes'm," said Bobby and started off.</p>

<p>"Here," called the man, "Wait a minute.
Here's a quarter for you." He drew out
another handful of money and selected
another shining white quarter, only it was not
so shiny as the other one. "Now skeedaddle
for Mr. Eller's."</p>

<p>Forgetting to thank the man for the
second quarter, Bobby started off, keeping
his eyes fixed on the house. When he had
gone a long ways he turned and looked back.
The Man with the Pocketful of Quarters
waved to him, and Bobby, after waving, too,
set resolutely onwards for the house far off
across the road.</p>

<p>Now it's hard to remember just what you
a going to do when one is a very little boy<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[25]</a></span>
and has just been given two whole quarters
all for his very own, particularly if the
disturbing thought <em>will</em> come to you that you
can have lots and lots of quarters and other
things given to you if you have birth&mdash;the
thing you musn't think about.</p>

<p>That reminded Bobby; he was sure that
he hadn't stepped on <em>It</em> while he wasn't
thinking or he would have felt it under his
foot as he did the spoon. Perhaps it might
be somewhere along this mysterious, inviting
white road, all covered with dust and lined
with trees and bushes, that wound away
further than anyone could see. It might
be just beyond that turn; there where the
meadow lark went sailing happily up into
the sky. He would go there and look.</p>

<p>Dragging his toes in the dust to see if his
lost birthdays might be covered up there,
Bobby gained the turn in the road, and the
next one, and the one beyond that, and still
trudged on, his short legs aching and stumbling.
He <em>wasn't</em> thinking about the thing he
musn't think about! Why didn't he feel it
under his feet? Perhaps because the water
wasn't in his eyes so he couldn't see, as it
had been when he stepped on the spoon.
He began to fear he couldn't go much
farther. Still he kept on.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[26]</a></span></p>

<p>Then suddenly the sun went entirely to
bed. Bobby began to be frightened for he
had never been out all alone with the darkness.
When it's all dark, little boys can't
tell what other things may be about. His
lip began to tremble and now the water <em>did</em>
come into his eyes. That interested him;
it was so when he stepped on the spoon; it
might be that he would find his&mdash;what he
was looking for&mdash;now, and he stumbled on
through the dust and the gathering darkness
towards the next turn in the road.</p>

<p>As he toiled on, he became conscious of a
gentle purring sound behind him that kept
getting louder and louder. He was almost
at the turn when there came a fierce honking
right behind him. Blinded by the water in
his eyes, he could but dimly see a great black
mysterious object almost on him when he
turned. He was too frightened to move.
The thing came to a sudden stop just a few
feet from him and he saw that it was only a
'mobile. A rough, young voice cried:</p>

<p>"Don't you know enough to get out of the
road when you hear a car coming, you little&mdash;"</p>

<p>"James! You might have struck him!"
cried a sweet, frightened voice from the body
of the 'mobile. "We ought not to have tried
to make home without having the lights on."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[27]</a></span></p>

<p>"Don't stand there in the way like a&mdash;&mdash;"
the rough, young voice began, but the
woman's voice interrupted:</p>

<p>"The child is crying! Open the door,
James."</p>

<p>Before he knew what she was going to do,
the lady was kneeling right in the dust of
the road by his side. She put her arms
about him and drew his head against her
breast. It was so soft and warm there and
so <em>safe</em> that Bobby cried all the harder for
very relief and his arms stole about the neck
of the lady until his fingers got tangled in her
soft hair.</p>

<p>"I <em>do</em> believe the child is lost," said the lady
and gathered Bobby up in her arms and
carried him into the 'mobile. "Light the
lamps, James," she added from the depths
of the black-cushioned seat.</p>

<p>James, who wore a pair of big glasses that
almost hid his face, turned on the lights,
and, through his tears, Bobby soon saw two
beams of light spurt out on the road ahead.</p>

<p>"Tell me your name, won't you?" begged
a low voice close to Bobby's ear.</p>

<p>He struggled to control his sobs enough to
answer.</p>

<p>"I like little boys," added the voice
coaxingly.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[28]</a></span></p>

<p>"B-B-Bob-b-by," he said at last, nestling
closer in those protecting arms.</p>

<p>"He's so tired he's falling asleep," said
the voice which was the sweetest Bobby had
ever heard.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_IV" id="CHAPTER_IV">CHAPTER IV</a></h2>

<div class='chaptertitle'>THE LADY WHO LIKES LITTLE BOYS</div>


<p>The next thing Bobby knew, he woke
up to find himself sitting in a great big,
soft red chair in a great big, red room
with as many as forty or a dozen red-shaded
lights, with a strange lady kneeling
in front of him. He looked into her
eyes, puzzled at finding she was not the
Supe'tendent.</p>

<p>"You don't remember one thing that happened,
do you?" laughed the lady.</p>

<p>"Yes'm," said Bobby after a pause, smiling
sleepily back at her. "You're the Lady Who
Likes Little Boys."</p>

<p>"You darling!" murmured the lady and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[30]</a></span>
squeezed Bobby until he could hardly
breathe. "Tell me where you live."</p>

<p>"There," and he pointed hesitatingly
towards the top of the door. "N-No, that
way. Don't know." The knowledge that
he was lost came to him and that lower lip
began to twitch tremulously.</p>

<p>"Never mind, dear, I'll find your home.
What is your father's name?"</p>

<p>Bobby's big brown eyes opened wide and
he stared at her unblinking for a while.</p>

<p>"Got none," he answered at last.</p>

<p>"Then your mother. What is her name?"</p>

<p>"Got none," he repeated.</p>

<p>"But she must have a name. Tell me
what you call her when she sits by your
bed at night and kisses you and tucks you
in," coaxed the lady.</p>

<p>Bobby sat up straight.</p>

<p>"Do mothers do that?"</p>

<p>"Why, yes. Don't you know?" And the
lady kissed Bobby.</p>

<p>"No'm," said Bobby wistfully.</p>

<p>"She must be worried frantic because you
don't come home. Tell me about her so
I can find her and tell her you are not
lost."</p>

<p>"Got no mothers," said Bobby after a long
pause.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[31]</a></span></p>

<p>"Who are you? What's the rest of your
name?"</p>

<p>"Bobby North, little imp."</p>

<p>The lady didn't like that: she almost
frowned.</p>

<p>"You're not <em>that</em> at all. Who ever told
you so?"</p>

<p>"Supe'tendent at the Home said so."</p>

<p>"Oh," said the lady, taking in her breath
quickly, "then you're&mdash;"</p>

<p>The Lady Who Likes Little Boys stopped:
then she put her arms about Bobby and
squeezed till he squirmed.</p>

<p>"Yes'm," said Bobby timidly, trying to
breathe.</p>

<p>"How did you come to be wandering alone
along the road?"</p>

<p>Bobby looked at her for a long time without
moving an eyelash.</p>

<p>"Please, will telling be thinking about it?"</p>

<p>"Not if you whisper it close in my
ear."</p>

<p>Bobby took his courage in both hands,
placed his lips close to her ear, shut both
eyes tight, and whispered all in a breath:</p>

<p>"Wanted to find my birthdays which I
lost before when I was too little to know
what it was."</p>

<p>"Your birthdays!" The lady was so surprised<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[32]</a></span>
that the smile faded from her lips.
"Have you lost <em>that?</em>"</p>

<p>"Hunted and hunted all day," said Bobby.
"And I <em>didn't</em> think about it&mdash;&mdash;Not <em>very</em>
much."</p>

<p>"Why didn't you think about it? Can't
you tell me?"</p>

<p>Bobby opened his eyes wide.</p>

<p>"'Cause if you don't think about it
maybe I'll step on it like the spoon."</p>

<p>"Who told you that?"</p>

<p>"The Man Who Lets You Play with the
Puppy."</p>

<p>"Who is he? Don't you remember his
name?"</p>

<p>"No'm," said Bobby after a long struggle
to think. "To-day is his birthdays."</p>

<p>"The Man's Who Lets You Play with the
Puppy?"</p>

<p>"His little boy's. He has eight of them
and presents, glassies, and a bat, and little
pigs to help buy you an edge-cation."</p>

<p>A delicious drowsiness crept all over
Bobby till his eyelids went all tickly and
prickly and he rubbed both fists into them.</p>

<p>"You're all tired out," said the lady, "and
hungry, too. I'm going to get you something
to eat and put you to bed. Would
you like to be my little boy tonight?"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[33]</a></span></p>

<p>For reply, Bobby flung both arms about
her neck and squeezed with all his might
until he squeezed a sob right out of her
throat. She took him up in her arms and
carried him out into a room with a big
shiny red table with two red chairs by it.
Then she rang a bell and soon a girl with a
little white apron came in.</p>

<p>"Sarah, bring me a glass of milk, some
bread and butter and jam."</p>

<p>"Why does that girl wear a little white
apron?" asked Bobby. "Is she a 'tendant?"</p>

<p>"No, she's the maid," replied the lady.</p>

<p>The girl seemed hardly to have had time
to leave the room before she was back,
bringing on a tray the bread, the milk, two
little cakes of butter and a dish all ready
to run over with red jam. The lady put lots
and lots of butter on the bread, besides all
the jam it could hold without running over
the edges, and watched Bobby eat it all up.
She didn't tell him to pick up the crumbs,&mdash;just
kept smiling at him and asked if he
could eat another piece. Of course he could!
But, as it happened, he couldn't, for he
hadn't eaten half of it when the prickling
in his eyelids got so bad he had to close them.</p>

<p>When he opened his eyes again, he was
in a little white bed in a little white room,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[34]</a></span>
and there&mdash;it couldn't be! He rubbed the
sleep out of his eyes. Yes, it was! A little
train with an engine and a whole string of
cars! He looked around.</p>

<p>In one corner of the room stood a baseball
bat with a catcher's glove, and there on the
little stand by the window was a box all
full of marbles, "glassies" and agates and
many other kinds. He felt queer and looked
down at himself and found he no longer had
on his own clothes but a nice clean nighty.</p>

<p>"What made you wake, dear?"</p>

<p>He twisted his head and there sat the
Lady Who Likes Little Boys, smiling at
him.</p>

<p>It took him a long time to think of the
reason.</p>

<p>"Please, I forgot 'Now I lay me'."</p>

<p>"Will you say it to me, right here at my
knees?"</p>

<p>Bobby climbed out of the bed, knelt by
the lady, laid his head on her knees and repeated
the sleep-forgotten prayer. He
looked up when he had finished and found the
lady had covered her face with both hands.
Perhaps she was saying her "Now I lay me,"
and Bobby kept still for a long time. Finally
he squirmed around for another look at the
train of cars.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[35]</a></span></p>

<p>The lady must have known that he was
through, for he felt gentle hands on his
shoulders.</p>

<p>"Who taught you that?" she asked.</p>

<p>"The 'tendant with the blue and white
dress."</p>

<p>"It's&mdash;it's beautiful," said the lady in a
voice that sounded very much like Bobby's
when he had water in his eyes.</p>

<p>He looked up and saw there was water
in <em>her</em> eyes! Suddenly he felt queer inside
and knew something without having been
told.</p>

<p>"Is the train your little boy's?"</p>

<p>"Yes, dear. This was his room."</p>

<p>"And his bed?"</p>

<p>"Yes; everything in the room was his."</p>

<p>"Where is your little boy?"</p>

<p>It was quite a long time before she replied
and then it was so low Bobby scarcely
heard.</p>

<p>"He's gone away."</p>

<p>"When did he go away?"</p>

<p>That seemed a very hard question to
answer.</p>

<p>"Three months ago," said the lady at
last, her fingers at her throat as though to
help the words come out.</p>

<p>"When's he coming back?"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[36]</a></span></p>

<p>The question this time was still harder
to answer.</p>

<p>"He's never coming back .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. never till I
.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. go for him. He was sick a long time .&nbsp;.&nbsp;.
until God had pity on him and took him
home."</p>

<p>"Are you going for him tonight?" asked
Bobby in that new, diffident voice.</p>

<p>"No, dear. I can't go for a long, long time."</p>

<p>"Not till he gets growed up?"</p>

<p>The Lady Who Likes Little Boys put a
handkerchief to her eyes before she answered.</p>

<p>"Not .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. not till God sends for me."</p>

<p>Bobby remained silent till his eyes fell on
the box of marbles.</p>

<p>"Can I play with the marbles till he comes
back?"</p>

<p>"Yes, dear, tomorrow when you've had
your sleep out."</p>

<p>Then Bobby looked at the little train
again and fell to wondering; perhaps this boy,
too, had birthdays. He turned to the lady.</p>

<p>"Did your little boy have birthdays?"</p>

<p>"Yes, dear. Day after tomorrow is his
birthday."</p>

<p>"Are you going to cel'brate it?"</p>

<p>"Yes .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. in my heart." It was just a
whisper that Bobby barely heard.</p>

<p>"How many birthdays did he have?"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[37]</a></span></p>

<p>"Seven."</p>

<p>Bobby considered that. The little boy
whose fathers was the Man Who Lets You
Play with the Puppy had eight birthdays and
the little boy whose mothers was the Lady
Who Likes Little Boys had seven. But <em>her</em>
little boy had gone away. Perhaps he
wouldn't mind letting him have just one of
his birthdays.</p>

<p>"Would he let me have just <em>one</em> of his
birthdays?"</p>

<p>The lady remained perfectly still and did
not answer. Bobby added wistfully:</p>

<p>"Just till I see what it's like? P'raps I
wouldn't want it any more. If I <em>did</em> like it,
then I could go on hunting for the birthdays
I lost."</p>

<p>He knew before she spoke that <em>her</em> little
boy wouldn't let him have one of his birthdays.</p>

<p>"Not his. I couldn't. Don't.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. There,
dear, go to sleep now and I'll.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;."</p>

<p>She didn't finish what she was saying,
but went quickly out, carrying her handkerchief
to her face. Bobby was too tired
to be very much disappointed, so tired
that he fell asleep almost before the swishing
of her dress had ceased to sound in his
ears.</p>

<div class='chaptertitle'>THE MAN WITH THE POCKETFUL OF
QUARTERS REAPPEARS</div>


<p>The Lady Who Likes Little Boys went
quickly into another room and took down
from a closet shelf a little suit of clothes and
gave way to tears, hugging the empty clothes
desperately to her heart.</p>

<p>After a time, a big man with a brown
mustache whose ends curled up, came into
the room, looked down pityingly at her, then
took her up in his arms like a little tired
child and held her silently while she wept her
heart out.</p>

<p>"You mustn't take his things out, Alice,"
said the man. "Not yet."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[39]</a></span></p>

<p>"I can't bear it, Alfred. I want him! I
won't try not to think of him!"</p>

<p>Mr. Anning placed his wife gently in a
chair and began to tell her about meeting a
small boy in the field who was hunting for
something he must not think about.</p>

<p>"For the birthdays he lost before he was
big enough to know what it was?" said his
wife smiling through her tears.</p>

<p>"Do you know him? Who is he?" asked
Mr. Anning eagerly.</p>

<p>For answer, his wife took him by the hand
and led him into the little white room where
Bobby lay fast asleep. Mr. Anning bent
quickly over him and exclaimed:</p>

<p>"Why, it's the very same! The little fellow
who lost his birthdays! And in Edward's
room. Now I understand, dear, why&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"It was not that," interrupted his wife,
and covered her eyes with her hand. "He
asked for just <em>one</em> of Edward's birthdays so
he could find out what it was like. And I
couldn't give it to him, Alfred! I couldn't!"</p>

<p>"Poor little chap," said her husband.
Then he took his wife by the hand and led
her out of the little white room.</p>

<p>They entered the red room just as Sarah,
the maid, ushered in Mr. Eller. He was
very much disturbed and spoke quickly.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[40]</a></span></p>

<p>"I'm sorry to trouble you, Mr. Anning,
but one of the children from the Home is
lost. I wonder if you would take your car
and&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Was he a little boy of five?" interrupted
Mrs. Anning.</p>

<p>"The boy who had lost his birthdays?"
questioned her husband.</p>

<p>"Yes," replied Mr. Eller. "Have you
found him?"</p>

<p>"He is upstairs fast asleep."</p>

<p>"You don't know what a relief that is!"
sighed Mr. Eller. "My wife is nearly distracted
at the thought that he may be
wandering about in the woods or the fields."</p>

<p>"We'll bring him over in the morning,"
said Mr. Anning.</p>

<p>"I think I'd better take him with me," said
Mr. Eller. "It will calm Mary to have him
right under her eyes with the other children."</p>

<p>"I know how she feels," said Mrs. Anning.
"I will get him ready."</p>

<p>After he had been asleep for a long, long
while, Bobby woke to find himself dressed in
his own clothes and in the arms of the Lady
Who Likes Little Boys. She was speaking.</p>

<p>"He is so tired and sleepy, Mr. Eller. It's
a pity to wake him. I wish you would let
me have him until morning."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[41]</a></span></p>

<p>"My wife's worried sick by his disappearance,"
replied a voice that was familiar to
Bobby. He turned his head about to see.
It was the Man Who Lets You Play with the
Puppy. In the doorway stood another man,
a big man with a mustache whose ends curled
up. He came forward, smiling at Bobby,
and held out his hand.</p>

<p>"Well, young man, I didn't expect to see
you again so soon, and in my own house,
too."</p>

<p>Bobby didn't know quite what to say to
that although he was sure the man was not
making fun of him, so he said nothing.</p>

<p>"You haven't forgotten me already, have
you?" continued the man.</p>

<p>"No'm," smiled Bobby. "You're the Man
with the Pocketful of Quarters."</p>

<p>"Right you are!" laughed the man and, to
prove it, drew out a handful of coins from
his pocket, selected a quarter and pressed it
into Bobby's palm.</p>

<p>The lady kissed Bobby good-bye while the
man looked pleadingly at her.</p>

<p>"I can't, Alfred! I can't!" she said all
choked up, and Bobby wondered what had
made her cry.</p>

<p>"No, of course, you can't, Alice, I understand."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[42]</a></span></p>

<p>The Man Who Lets You Play with the
Puppy took Bobby from the Lady and
carried him out. Bobby looked back and
saw the Man with the Pocketful of Quarters
put his arm about the Lady Who Likes
Little Boys.</p>

<p>Bobby did not see the 'mobile drive up
toward evening of the next day for he was
out in the yard at Mr. Eller's playing with
the St. Bernard puppy. He was running
with all his might, the puppy right at his
heels, when he looked up and saw the Lady
Who Likes Little Boys coming swiftly
towards him. He stopped quite still for a
time, then ran with all his might right into
her arms and tangled his fingers among the
soft hair at the back of her neck.</p>

<p>"Oh, Bobby, I just can't let you go back
to the .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. Home, without your first knowing
what a birthdays is."</p>

<p>"Have you found it? Is it mine?" asked
Bobby eagerly.</p>

<p>"Not yours, Bobby. My little boy is
going to lend you&mdash;one of his."</p>

<p>Bobby squirmed in delight.</p>

<p>"Day after tomorrow?"</p>

<p>"Tomorrow," smiled the lady.</p>

<p>"When will that be?"</p>

<p>"Soon, dear. I'll tell you when it comes."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[43]</a></span></p>

<p>Bobby remained in thought for a long
while.</p>

<p>"Your little boy won't be mad at you?"</p>

<p>"No, Bobby. He was always generous&mdash;just
like his father." Then she said something
that Bobby decided was addressed to
herself and not to him. "I can't be less
generous."</p>

<p>Bobby squeezed her neck until his arms
ached. Then he remembered something she
had just said.</p>

<p>"Did your little boy have fathers, too?"</p>

<p>"Yes. He's waiting in the car. Let's go
to him, will you? Mrs. Eller is going to let
you spend the night with us."</p>

<p>Holding hands, they went out through the
yard, while the deserted puppy sat on his
haunches and stared forlornly after his little
playmate who did not even look back.</p>

<p>When they got to the car, there sat the
Man With the Pocketful of Quarters! So
<em>that</em> was the fathers of the little boy who was
going to lend him a birthdays!</p>

<p>"Well, son," said the man as they solemnly
shook hands, "we're going to show you what
a real birthdays is."</p>

<p>"Yes'm?" queried Bobby as he was lifted
into the 'mobile.</p>

<p>"Sure thing. It will be birthday all day<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[44]</a></span>
long, from the moment you open your eyes
until the Sandman comes."</p>

<p>Bobby snuggled happily at the side of the
lady in the back seat, while the car sped
swiftly on towards the house with the little
white room with the little train and a whole
string of little cars.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_VI" id="CHAPTER_VI">CHAPTER VI</a></h2>

<div class='chaptertitle'>THE BORROWED BIRTHDAY</div>


<p>"Is it tomorrow now?" asked Bobby
eagerly as he awoke the next morning in the
little white room and found the Lady Who
Likes Little Boys bending over him.</p>

<p>"Yes, this is day-after-tomorrow."</p>

<p>"Your little boy's birthday?"</p>

<p>The reply was a long time in coming.</p>

<p>"It's your birthday this time, dear."</p>

<p>"For all day and always?"</p>

<p>"For all day long."</p>

<p>Bobby felt of himself all over and then
announced wistfully:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[46]</a></span></p>

<p>"It doesn't not feel any different, having
birthdays&mdash;not yet."</p>

<p>"Wait, Bobby, until you have had your
bath and breakfast, then maybe it will be
different."</p>

<p>Bobby didn't mind the bath this time at
all, only he was in a tremendous hurry to
get through with it, and when he was seated
at the table he scampered through breakfast
very quickly without being scolded once.
He did not even notice that the girl with the
little white apron did not bring him things
to eat as she had the night before. He was
back in the red room with the forty or a
dozen red-shaded lights, now all put out,
shaking hands with the Man With the
Pocketful of Quarters, when the maid came
into the room and said:</p>

<p>"It's all ready now, sir."</p>

<p>"All right, Sarah," replied the man and
the girl left the room.</p>

<p>"We're going to start out <em>this</em> birthday
right, son."</p>

<p>"Yes'm," said Bobby, watching him with
eyes that sparkled expectantly.</p>

<p>"Up in the room where you slept," continued
the man, "are a lot of things that
small boys like. I want you to go up there
alone and look them over. Then you are<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[47]</a></span>
to pick out the <em>one</em> thing that you want most
of all&mdash;just one. That will be yours for
keeps."</p>

<p>"'Glassies' or the bat or the train?" asked
Bobby.</p>

<p>"It's just <em>one</em> thing for now," interposed
the lady. "There will be&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Don't give me away, Alice," pleaded
the man.</p>

<p>Bobby wondered how she <em>could</em> give away
the Man With the Pocketful of Quarters,
but soon forgot that thinking about more
important matters.</p>

<p>"Or little pigs to buy an edge-cation with
curly tails?" pursued Bobby.</p>

<p>The man burst out into a big laugh that
filled the room.</p>

<p>"I haven't a doubt but what you'll have a
curly-tailed edge-cation all right, Bobby,
when the time comes, pigs or no pigs."</p>

<p>"Yes'm," smiled Bobby not knowing quite
what the man meant.</p>

<p>"Come," said the lady. "I'll go as far as
the door with you."</p>

<p>And that was as far as she <em>did</em> go. Her
hand slipped gently over Bobby's straight
blond hair and lingered there before she
pushed him into the room and closed the
door between them.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[48]</a></span></p>

<p>Bobby stopped at the head of the little bed
which had already been made up, and looked
carefully about the room. There was the
enchanting train all ready to get up steam
to carry him away into that strange land
where red Indians tomahawk little boys, or
where pirates dig all day in the white
sand making places to hide yellow gold in.
And there on the bed was the box of marbles,
"glassies," agates and all, and a little blue
sailor suit, and a baseball bat, and a whole
row of quarters, and there&mdash;</p>

<p>Bobby's eyes opened wide and he made a
jump for the thing that was almost hidden
in the pocket of the sailor suit. It <em>couldn't</em>
be, and yet it <em>was!</em> The shiningest, white-handled
pocket knife a boy ever had! He
counted the blades; there were three of
them, but not one of them could he open.
He sat down on the floor and tried and tried to
open those blades, oblivious to everything else.</p>

<p>Before very long he became aware of a
barely audible scratching sound. It was
soon followed by a high-pitched whine.
Bobby looked eagerly all about; a strange
excitement thrilled his blood, but didn't see
anything that <em>could</em> make such a noise.</p>

<p>At last he leaned clear over until his head
almost touched the floor and looked under<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[49]</a></span>
the bed. Way down at the foot of it was
something in a basket, that moved. Bobby
watched fascinated, hardly daring to breathe.
The whining came again. Then the dearest
little black nose was lifted above the edge
of the basket and two soft brown eyes looked
into Bobby's.</p>

<p>Bobby shouted and the puppy yelped at
the same instant. Bobby, forgetting that
he could walk around the bed, crawled under
it. The puppy tried just as hard to come to
him. It managed to get half way out of
the basket when Bobby's face came down
against its black nose. Puppy and boy
mingled affection and gratitude.</p>

<p>The puppy's ugly face and wide-apart bow-legs
were at that moment the most beautiful
things in the world to Bobby. Even birthdays
were forgotten and he hugged and
patted that worshipping creature for a long,
long time before recollection of the Lady
Who Likes Little Boys caused him to crawl
hastily out from under the bed, burst through
the door, and tear wildly downstairs to the
red room, the puppy clutched to his heart.</p>

<p>The Man with the Pocketful of Quarters
sat at the table in the corner, talking to the
Lady. They both looked up.</p>

<p>"Well, son, is that what you want most?"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[50]</a></span></p>

<p>"Yes'm," smiled Bobby. "Is it <em>all</em> mine?"</p>

<p>"Head, body and tail," replied the man.</p>

<p>"It knew me!" exulted Bobby.</p>

<p>The man and the lady exchanged laughs.</p>

<p>"He's all boy," said the man. "Made of
the right stuff."</p>

<p>The lady patted the man's shoulder and
looked away.</p>

<p>"Come here, son, and tell me what you
think about birthdays."</p>

<p>Bobby marched close up to the man.</p>

<p>"Wish it was mine."</p>

<p>The wistful note in his voice made the
lady's hands fly out to him.</p>

<p>"Oh, you like it, do you?" asked the man.
"Well, this birthday has only just started."</p>

<p>"Yes'm," said Bobby and hugged the
squirming puppy till it licked his ear.</p>

<p>"Here's another quarter for you. That's
four quarters&mdash;quite a sum for a small boy."</p>

<p>Bobby took one hand off the puppy long
enough to accept the quarter.</p>

<p>"What have you done with the others,
Bobby?" asked the lady.</p>

<p>He fished them out of the pocket of his
blouse and held all four out in the palm of his
hand.</p>

<p>"That makes a dollar, son. That's a whole
lot of money for a boy only five years old."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[51]</a></span></p>

<p>That set Bobby to wondering.</p>

<p>"Is it lots of money for a little boy with
<em>seven</em> birthdays?" he asked.</p>

<p>"You can just bet your boots it is. A boy
can buy all sorts of things with a dollar."</p>

<p>As he spoke, the man pulled a great, round
white piece of money out of his pocket,
thereby revealing to Bobby that his pockets
contained other things besides quarters, and
making him forget that four quarters <em>is</em> an
awful lot of money even for a boy with seven
birthdays.</p>

<p>"Know what this is?" asked the man.</p>

<p>"Money," replied Bobby.</p>

<p>"How much money?"</p>

<p>"A grown-up quarter," hazarded Bobby at
length.</p>

<p>"It's a dollar," replied the man, "and is
worth just as much as the four quarters.
Would you rather have your money all in
one piece? I'll give you the dollar for the
four quarters."</p>

<p>Bobby hesitated in perplexity and the
Lady came to his rescue.</p>

<p>"Take the big piece, Bobby. It's not so easy
to lose and easier to find if you do lose it."</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_VII" id="CHAPTER_VII">CHAPTER VII</a></h2>

<div class='chaptertitle'>ALL THE PERQUISITES PERTAINING
THERETO</div>


<p>Bobby obediently exchanged the four
quarters for the dollar despite the frantic
efforts of the puppy to see what was going
on. The dollar was heavy in his hand and
it was very thick. Bobby felt quite wealthy,
able to buy all sorts of things, an edge-cation
or .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. or perhaps even birthdays! His eyes
grew big and round.</p>

<p>The Man with the Pocketful of Quarters
had just said a moment before that a boy
could buy all sorts of things with a dollar.
And a dollar is lots of money even to a boy
with seven birthdays! In his excitement<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[53]</a></span>
Bobby almost dropped the puppy, retaining
his hold on that delight by one leg only.
His eyes sparkled with the intensity of the
desire lighted in them.</p>

<p>"Is it enough to buy a birthdays?" he
asked, stammering in his eagerness.</p>

<p>The lady gasped at the question and the
man was too staggered to do anything at
first; finally he exploded into that huge
laughter which always seemed to Bobby to
fill the room. He didn't mind the laughter
for he knew the man was not making fun of
him.</p>

<p>"I don't know, Bobby," said the man
when he had stopped laughing. "I've never
heard of anybody selling his birthday. You
might try and see."</p>

<p>Bobby turned at once to the Lady Who
Likes Little Boys.</p>

<p>"Your little boy ain't not never coming
back," he fairly stammered in his excitement.
"Would he sell me a birthdays?"</p>

<p>And he held out the round, shining dollar.</p>

<p>The lady shrank back from him and went
suddenly all white. Bobby knew he had
done something wrong, but couldn't for the
life of him imagine what it was.</p>

<p>The father of the boy with seven birthdays
went quickly to his wife.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[54]</a></span></p>

<p>"He's got grit and perseverance," said
the man. "A birthday looks good to him
and he won't give up till he gets one. It
would make him happy as a king, Alice."</p>

<p>She hid her face on his shoulder.</p>

<p>"I can't, Alfred. Don't ask that."</p>

<p>Bobby didn't understand what it was <em>she</em>
couldn't do, but felt that he had in some way
hurt her and his lower lip began to move
unsteadily.</p>

<p>"It's only day-after-tomorrow, Alice,"
pleaded the man.</p>

<p>"It's Edward's," replied the Lady. "You
have no heart or you couldn't.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;."</p>

<p>The man looked at Bobby and then said
in a low voice to his wife:</p>

<p>"Day-after-tomorrow is never to-day."</p>

<p>Bobby's heart smote him anew, for he saw
water running down the Lady's face as she
lifted her head. It had all been caused by
his wanting a birthdays. Very well, he
would pretend he didn't want a birthdays
any more; then perhaps the water would go
out of the Lady's eyes.</p>

<p>"Don't want a birthdays," he announced
with a suspicious dolefulness in his voice.
"It doesn't not feel good."</p>

<p>"Look at him, Alice," said the man.</p>

<p>Bobby didn't want the Lady to see the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[55]</a></span>
water in <em>his</em> eyes, so he tried to rub it out,
but the tightly clutched dollar got in the
way, and the lady must have seen what he
was doing, for she simply rushed at Bobby
and gathered him, puppy, dollar and all, into
her arms and kissed him forty or a dozen
times and held his face against her wet
cheek.</p>

<p>"Birthdays can't be bought, Bobby, but
you shall have one all of your very own.
I'll <em>give</em> you one."</p>

<p>"Don't not want any," whimpered Bobby.</p>

<p>"Not if <em>I</em> give you one?" asked the lady,
wiping the water out of her eyes. "We'll
give you our little boy's."</p>

<p>Bobby kept perfectly still and in that stillness
a miracle was performed; that trembling
lip of his, without stopping its trembling, was
transformed into a joyful smile. And when
the Lady saw it, <em>she</em> smiled too.</p>

<p>"I've been selfish and .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. rebellious," said
her sweet, low voice right at his ear, but she
was looking up at the Man with the Pocketful
of Quarters when she said it.</p>

<p>The man blew his nose and made such a
loud noise that it startled Bobby and the
Lady. They looked into one another's face
and then began to smile like persons sharing
a happy secret that no one else knew.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[56]</a></span></p>

<p>"I'll draw it up on paper, son," said the
man, "and then if you ever lose it again,
whoever finds the paper will know <em>that</em>
birthday belongs to you and return it."</p>

<p>He went to the writing desk in one corner
of the room, took paper, pen and ink and
began to write. When all the water had gone
out of the eyes of Bobby and the Lady, they
went over to watch the man who was writing
away rapidly and smiling to himself.</p>

<p>"There you are," he said at last, with a
concluding flourish, and handed the paper to
his wife. She smiled as if it hurt her to
read what he had written, and pressed Bobby
more closely to her.</p>

<p>"Now we must sign it," said the man.</p>

<p>With another flourish, he wrote his name
on the paper. His wife's lip trembled just
like Bobby's as she signed it. Then the
man took Bobby on his lap and guided his
hand in making a big cross, and then wrote
something himself above and below the
mark Bobby made.</p>

<p>"Is that a birthdays?" asked Bobby.</p>

<p>"No," replied the Lady, "it's just proof
that we have given you a birthday. If
anybody ever doesn't believe you have one,
just show him that, and he'll know that you
have."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[57]</a></span></p>

<p>"I'll read it to you, son," said the man
and proceeded to read in a big, booming
voice:</p>

<p>"Done at Our House this Second Day of
August, 1916. We, Alfred and Alice Anning,
do hereby and herewith give and convey to
Bobby North, Day-After-Tomorrow, which
on every Second Day of August becomes To-Day,
to be his very own birthday forever.
<em>This</em> Day-After-Tomorrow is his fifth birthday;
the next one will be his sixth. No one
can take this birthday from him because it is
ours to give. Whenever Day-After-Tomorrow
comes, the aforesaid Bobby North
is to have his birthday with a celebration
and all the perquisites pertaining thereto.
In witness whereof our signatures are herewith

<p>"There, I guess that's all ship-shape and
tight enough so water can't leak through,"
said the man and offered the paper to Bobby.
He accepted it gravely, as one should in such
important matters, then smiled up at the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[58]</a></span>
Lady whose lip still twitched curiously. He
looked thoughtfully at the paper in his hand.</p>

<p>"A birthdays and perk&mdash;perk&mdash;"</p>

<p>"And all the perquisites pertaining thereto,"
said the man, helping him out.</p>

<p>"What is perk-<em>wiz</em>its?" Bobby asked.</p>

<p>"Perk-<em>wiz</em>its," replied the man gravely, "are
the things that go with birthdays, a celebration,
marbles, cake and ice cream, pocket
knives, pigs and pups. Why, look at that pup!"</p>

<p>Bobby looked and the puppy had the
precious bit of paper in his mouth and was
trying to swallow it!</p>

<p>The man opened the puppy's mouth and
rescued Bobby's birthdays.</p>

<p>"I was only just in time," he confided to
Bobby. "A second later and that dog
would have swallowed it. Then where would
your birthdays have been?"</p>

<p>Bobby took time to consider. In due
course he arrived at a decision.</p>

<p>"Long's the puppy's mine, I'd have the
birthdays, too."</p>

<p>He joined in the laughter of his two friends
without quite knowing why.</p>

<p>"Keep the paper in your pocket, Bobby.
If the dog eats it you couldn't prove to anybody
that you had a birthday. Now we
are going to continue the celebration."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[59]</a></span></p>

<p>All day long that celebration lasted and
Bobby was so happy and excited and had so
many good things to eat and so many wonderful
things to do that he didn't know where
the hours had gone when the man said the
day was almost over and that it was time to
take him back to Mr. Eller's.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_VIII" id="CHAPTER_VIII">CHAPTER VIII</a></h2>

<div class='chaptertitle'>FATHERS AND MOTHERS AND
THINGS LIKE THAT</div>


<p>The Lady Who Likes Little Boys took
Bobby into the house to get him ready while
the man was bringing the 'mobile out to the
gate. The car was waiting long before the
Lady had Bobby ready. She was very slow
about it; first she held him tight and ran her
fingers through his hair; then she put his
hat on, and took it off to smooth his hair
again. Next she brushed his clothes. Finally
she put the puppy in his arms and gathered
up all the presents which Bobby was to
take with him.</p>

<p>There came a sudden honking from the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[61]</a></span>
waiting 'mobile, the Lady hastily kissed
Bobby, put on his hat for the last time, and
led him out of the house. She helped Bobby
into the car and very slowly arranged his
presents about him in the back seat. Then,
reluctantly, she closed the door.</p>

<p>"Aren't you coming with us, Alice?"
asked the man. "The ride will do you good."</p>

<p>"No," she replied, "the day is over for
me.</p>

<p>"Why, the sun hasn't not gone to bed&mdash;<em>quite</em>,"
said Bobby, for the edge of the round,
red ball in the West had not yet touched the
horizon.</p>

<p>"All right, son, we're off," said the man
and honked the horn, and the wheels began
to go slowly 'round.</p>

<p>"Wait, Alfred!" called his wife in an unsteady
voice and her hands went out quickly
towards Bobby.</p>

<p>The 'mobile came to a sudden stop, the
Lady opened the door and snatched Bobby
out and to her breast.</p>

<p>"I can't let you go, Bobby. They wouldn't
celebrate your birthday at the Home. They
wouldn't know how."</p>

<p>"I'm afraid it wouldn't be much like a
birthday there; not after this one," said the
man.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[62]</a></span></p>

<p>The Lady put Bobby down and he seized
the opportunity to readjust his hold on the
puppy and to look into his blouse pocket to
see if the precious bit of paper was still
there.</p>

<p>"May I, Alfred?" he heard the Lady Who
Likes Little Boys saying to the man in the
'mobile.</p>

<p>"Alice!" cried the man. "I love you a
thousand times better than ever!"</p>

<p>That seemed a very funny sort of answer
to Bobby; there was no sense in it. He
looked up and found the Lady's arms held
out to him.</p>

<p>"Bobby, would you like to stay with us
and be <em>my</em> little boy? Then, every year
when your birthday comes, we could celebrate
it together."</p>

<p>Bobby's eyes glistened. He looked from
her to the man and back again. They were
both smiling at him.</p>

<p>"Will you be my mothers, then?"</p>

<p>"Yes, dear, I'll be your mother."</p>

<p>Then, forgetting all about the puppy,
which fell to the ground with a surprised
little yelp, Bobby rushed to the Lady Who
Likes Little Boys and threw his arms passionately
about her neck as she knelt to
receive him. They both squeezed just as<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[63]</a></span>
hard as they could and the Lady laughed and
cried and then laughed again.</p>

<p>Bobby sighed with complete happiness.
He had found a birthdays and already that
magical thing was bringing him all sorts of
presents&mdash;puppies and perk-<em>wiz</em>its and "glassies"
and mothers and perhaps curly-tailed
little pigs to buy him an edge-cation. He
hugged the Lady again.</p>

<p>"Well, son, you seem to like mothers."</p>

<p>Bobby looked up and saw that the Man
with the Pocketful of Quarters had climbed
out of the 'mobile and was standing over
them.</p>

<p>"Yes'm," replied Bobby and twined his
fingers in the soft hair at the back of the
Lady's neck.</p>

<p>"And fathers, too?" smiled the lady.</p>

<p>Bobby drew back and looked at her with
shining eyes.</p>

<p>"Have I fathers, too?"</p>

<p>"Yes, dear. You will love him because he
likes little boys, too."</p>

<p>Bobby thought that over, then looked up
with a shy smile at the man.</p>

<p>"The Man Who Lets You Play with the
Puppy?" he asked.</p>

<p>"No, dear," said his mothers, "not that
man&mdash;The Man with the Pocketful of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[64]</a></span>
Quarters. Will you shake hands with him?"</p>

<p>"Why <em>he's</em> the Man Who Lets You Play
with the Puppy, too!" said Bobby, anticipating
the fact.</p>

<p>"Already he's found me out!" laughed the
man.</p>

<p>Smilingly, Bobby held out his hand to his
fathers.</p>
